# MusicScraper Readme
This is a small program I wrote to scratch my own itch. I wanted a way to quickly download all the mp3 files from my favorite music blogs for later listening. 

# How to Use
(1) Install the BeautifulSoup library. It is required.
(2) Edit the mp3scraper.py file. Replace the variables at the bottom of the file: url and dlmusicfolder. url is the url link for the website that you would like to download the mp3s. dlmusicfolder is the local folder that you'd like to download the files to.
(3) Run the file using the following command: python mp3scraper.py
